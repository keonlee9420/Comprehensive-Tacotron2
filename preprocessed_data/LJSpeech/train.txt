LJ045-0031|LJSpeech|During the week, Oswald lived in a roominghouse in Dallas, but he usually called his wife on the telephone twice a day.
LJ032-0114|LJSpeech|Additional evidence of ownership was provided in the form of palmprint identification which indicated that Oswald had possession of the rifle he had purchased.

LJ004-0121|LJSpeech|to which a total of upwards of one hundred thousand prisoners had been committed in the year, only twenty-three prisons were divided according to law;
LJ003-0125|LJSpeech|The evidence was invariably sufficient to convict, and the judge never hesitated to inflict the heaviest penalties.

LJ037-0075|LJSpeech|However, even in the absence of Mrs. Markham's testimony, there is ample evidence to identify Oswald as the killer of Tippit.

LJ031-0214|LJSpeech|The autopsy examination revealed two wounds in the President's head.
LJ006-0101|LJSpeech|some, who had the semblance of covering on the upper part of their feet, had no soles to the shoes, and their bare feet were on the ground.
LJ007-0095|LJSpeech|Prisoners indeed were known to boast that they had saved their necks by feigning insanity.
LJ010-0009|LJSpeech|People, too, were getting into the habit of carrying but little cash about them, and no valuables but their watches or personal jewelery.

LJ036-0043|LJSpeech|Riding on the bus was an elderly woman, Mary Bledsoe, who confirmed the mute evidence of the transfer.
LJ008-0030|LJSpeech|The first affair of the kind on this spot was on the third December, seventeen eighty-three,
LJ048-0178|LJSpeech|In accordance with its regular procedures, no survey or other check was made by the Secret Service, or by any other law enforcement agency at its request,
LJ028-0193|LJSpeech|and to them came hope of returning to Jerusalem.
LJ012-0276|LJSpeech|While she was senseless, but really still alive, he cut off her head, and dismembered the body in the manner already described.
LJ040-0051|LJSpeech|While there is doubt about how fully Oswald understood the doctrine which he so often espoused, it seems clear
LJ033-0178|LJSpeech|This was done as an investigatory aid
LJ006-0194|LJSpeech|Gaming of all kinds, although forbidden by the Jail Acts, was habitually practiced.
LJ007-0166|LJSpeech|Strong as were the foregoing remarks, the inspectors wound up their report in still more trenchant language

LJ002-0270|LJSpeech|The latter's salary, with fees, the rent of the tap and of the chandler's shop, amounted to about six hundred pounds a year.
LJ046-0188|LJSpeech|In summary, at the time of the assassination
LJ049-0213|LJSpeech|There are always dangers of divided responsibility,
LJ030-0216|LJSpeech|Between the time he originally seized the handhold and the time he mounted the car, Hill recalled:

LJ046-0148|LJSpeech|that the safety of the President is or might be in danger, either at the present or in the future.
LJ019-0097|LJSpeech|This want of uniformity in prison discipline became ere long an acknowledged evil pressing for some remedy,
LJ009-0138|LJSpeech|all the avenues to the prison gates were blocked by ticket-holders.
LJ047-0176|LJSpeech|shortly after Oswald rented the room on October fourteen.

LJ040-0064|LJSpeech|This occurred two months before Lee was born in New Orleans on October eighteen, nineteen thirty-nine.
LJ042-0018|LJSpeech|On the other hand, at least one person who knew Oswald after his return thought that his defection had a more personal and psychological basis.
LJ036-0112|LJSpeech|Whaley said that Oswald was the man under Number two.

LJ041-0176|LJSpeech|He recalled that Oswald had a specific interest in Latin America, particularly Cuba,

LJ043-0008|LJSpeech|De Mohrenschildt was a peripheral member of the so-called Russian community, with which Oswald made contact through Mr. Peter Gregory,

LJ008-0069|LJSpeech|The latter is the method still followed at Newgate.

LJ033-0058|LJSpeech|On the day of the assassination, Marina Oswald was watching television when she learned of the shooting.
LJ018-0044|LJSpeech|There was the prisoner's poverty, his inability to account for himself on the night of the murder, and his possession of the property of the murdered man.

LJ048-0133|LJSpeech|Constant reevaluation of procedures, with attention to special problems and the development of instructions specific to particular trips
LJ002-0049|LJSpeech|leading to two wards, one of which was thirty-six feet by fifteen,
LJ011-0075|LJSpeech|One was that of Captain Montgomery, who assumed the aliases of Colonel Wallace and Colonel Morgan.
LJ003-0257|LJSpeech|Searches were made certainly, but they were too often superficial, or they might be evaded by a trifling bribe.
LJ030-0105|LJSpeech|Communications in the motorcade.
LJ029-0043|LJSpeech|and coordinating local activities with the White House staff, the organizations directly concerned with the visit, and local law enforcement officials.
LJ004-0197|LJSpeech|No idleness was permitted among the inmates. Trades were taught, or prisoners were allowed to follow their own if suitable.
LJ019-0299|LJSpeech|but in one prison it was such that the prisoners' food was supplied daily from the neighboring inn, and the innkeeper's bill constituted the only accounts kept.
LJ018-0088|LJSpeech|I propose next to describe the leading features of the most important of these.

LJ031-0007|LJSpeech|Chief of Police Curry and police motorcyclists at the head of the motorcade led the way to the hospital.
LJ019-0184|LJSpeech|The Corporation had agreed to spend twenty thousand pounds on alterations, but sixty thousand pounds would suffice to reconstruct.
LJ016-0013|LJSpeech|It was noticed that he was most anxious to receive a pair of shoes for which he had asked, and when they arrived they were closely examined.
LJ047-0194|LJSpeech|Hosty received this information on the afternoon of November twenty-two, nineteen sixty-three.
LJ014-0159|LJSpeech|Manning's demeanor was more in harmony with his situation, and the full confession he made

LJ044-0015|LJSpeech|He first distributed his handbills and other material uneventfully in the vicinity of the U.S.S. Wasp,
LJ037-0046|LJSpeech|The man, quote, in kind of a little trot, end quote, headed down Patton toward Jefferson Boulevard, a block away.

LJ025-0020|LJSpeech|although the parts of some plants exhibit oscillating movements without any perceptible cause and the leaves of others retract when touched,
LJ018-0325|LJSpeech|But extra precautions and close supervision have so far proved effectual, and the prisoners are still in custody after a lapse of ten years.
LJ001-0098|LJSpeech|and the whole effect is a little too gray, owing to the thinness of the letters.
LJ001-0084|LJSpeech|But for the beauty of the earlier work they might have seemed tolerable.
LJ040-0186|LJSpeech|Lee scored an I.Q. of one eighteen on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children.

LJ042-0010|LJSpeech|it appears that personal and psychological factors were also involved.
LJ031-0030|LJSpeech|Governor Connally, who had lost consciousness on the ride to the hospital, regained consciousness when the limousine stopped abruptly at the emergency entrance.
LJ029-0164|LJSpeech|Also on November nineteen, the Morning News reported that the President's motorcade would travel from Love Field along specified streets, then
LJ014-0326|LJSpeech|Maltby and Co. would issue warrants on them deliverable to the importer, and the goods were then passed to be stored in neighboring warehouses.

LJ012-0243|LJSpeech|There were many features of resemblance in these crimes.
LJ050-0276|LJSpeech|As has been pointed out, the Commission has not resolved all the proposals which could be made. The Commission nevertheless is confident that,

LJ044-0168|LJSpeech|During this period Oswald may have practiced opening and closing the bolt on his rifle in a screened porch in his apartment.
LJ041-0134|LJSpeech|Governor Connally's connection with the discharge, although indirect, caused the Commission to consider whether he might have been Oswald's real target.
LJ028-0260|LJSpeech|The following story from Herodotus tells the results:

LJ001-0126|LJSpeech|Most of Jenson's letters are designed within a square,
LJ039-0191|LJSpeech|Oswald engaged in such practice. If the assassin missed either the first or third shot,
LJ032-0085|LJSpeech|The Hidell signature on the notice of classification was in the handwriting of Oswald.

LJ022-0045|LJSpeech|Therefore, let us keep our minds on two or three simple, essential facts in connection with this problem of unemployment.
LJ050-0162|LJSpeech|In planning its data processing techniques,
LJ044-0145|LJSpeech|By August of nineteen sixty-three, Oswald had for some time been considering the possibility of leaving the United States again.

LJ012-0092|LJSpeech|This occurred in November eighteen thirty-four. The Custom House officials were in a state of consternation,

LJ050-0228|LJSpeech|The Commission urges that the Bureau of the Budget review these recommendations with the Secret Service and authorize a request for the necessary supplemental appropriation,

LJ043-0046|LJSpeech|After about a month with his brother,

LJ036-0021|LJSpeech|On the basis of this punchmark, which was distinctive to each Dallas driver,
LJ049-0182|LJSpeech|In addition, the Commission has concluded that the Secret Service particularly tends to be the passive recipient of information
LJ024-0071|LJSpeech|I propose that hereafter, when a judge reaches the age of seventy,
LJ038-0266|LJSpeech|Frazier testified further that the FBI avoids the category of "probable" identification.
LJ031-0135|LJSpeech|Concern that the Vice President might also be a target for assassination prompted the Secret Service agents to urge him to leave the hospital and return to Washington immediately.

LJ047-0179|LJSpeech|Hosty did nothing further in connection with the Oswald case until after the assassination. On November one, nineteen sixty-three,

LJ048-0089|LJSpeech|Against the background of the critical events of November twenty-two, however,

LJ022-0125|LJSpeech|every profession has its black sheep, but long experience in government has taught me
LJ050-0159|LJSpeech|The Commission recommends that prompt and favorable consideration be given to this request.
LJ047-0250|LJSpeech|Brian did not hear Hosty make any statement concerning Oswald's capacity to be an assassin
LJ035-0130|LJSpeech|Actually she noticed no one on the back stairs. If she descended from the fourth to the first floor as fast as she claimed in her testimony,

LJ008-0049|LJSpeech|and this, being much more sudden and regular than that of a cart being drawn away, has the effect of immediate death.
LJ014-0282|LJSpeech|There were two counts in the indictment: one for stealing a cheque value fourteen hundred pounds, the second for stealing a bit of paper value one penny.
LJ008-0244|LJSpeech|now laughed at, the skirt of his seedy black coat torn across; yet,
LJ011-0283|LJSpeech|One was a cheque for eight hundred pounds on his bankers, the other an order to Mr. Bell of Newport, Essex, requesting the surrender of a deed.

LJ039-0137|LJSpeech|On that occasion Oswald again used a bolt-action twenty-two caliber rifle; and according to Robert,

LJ012-0281|LJSpeech|The most ghastly part of the story is that which deals with his getting rid of the head.
LJ047-0051|LJSpeech|particularly since his employment did not involve any sensitive information.
LJ019-0081|LJSpeech|The use of gas or some other means of lighting might be adopted, but more often was dispensed with.

LJ003-0007|LJSpeech|hundreds of women and children came in every morning to spend the day there, and there was no limitation whatever to the numbers of visitors admitted to the debtors' side.
LJ038-0295|LJSpeech|An official of this church told FBI agents that services are held every Wednesday at the church except during the month of August.
LJ036-0078|LJSpeech|claimed that about fifteen minutes after the assassination he saw a man, whom he later identified as Oswald,
LJ017-0232|LJSpeech|The captain's brother, a passenger on board the 'Flowery Land,' was also stabbed to death and his body thrown overboard.
LJ050-0040|LJSpeech|and reports from other agencies which independently evaluate their information for potential sources of danger.
LJ036-0101|LJSpeech|He was taken to the lineup room where, according to Whaley, five young teenagers, all handcuffed together, were displayed with Oswald.
LJ042-0158|LJSpeech|left a far mean streak of independence brought on by neglect.
LJ030-0239|LJSpeech|Youngblood was not positive that he was in the rear seat before the second shot, but thought it probable because of President Johnson's statement
LJ015-0271|LJSpeech|He dealt too in the precious metals, when they had been improperly acquired,
LJ003-0157|LJSpeech|The best accommodation the jail could offer was reserved for the prisoners on the state side,
LJ035-0210|LJSpeech|On the basis of these findings the Commission has concluded that Oswald, at the time of the assassination,
LJ011-0027|LJSpeech|The veil was lifted from his private life, and he was accused of persistent immorality.
LJ034-0070|LJSpeech|During the morning of November twenty-two, Givens was working with the floor-laying crew in the southwest section of the sixth floor.
LJ044-0172|LJSpeech|and left for Irving with Marina Oswald and June and most of the Oswalds' effects three days later.

LJ037-0098|LJSpeech|that he saw Oswald on television the night of the murder and thought that Oswald was the man he had seen running away from the shooting.
LJ003-0073|LJSpeech|Indeed the partial classification attempted seems to have been abandoned within a year or two.
LJ019-0248|LJSpeech|leading to an inequality, uncertainty, and inefficiency of punishment productive of the most prejudicial results.
LJ001-0173|LJSpeech|The essential point to be remembered is that the ornament, whatever it is, whether picture or pattern-work, should form part of the page,
LJ038-0133|LJSpeech|Oswald responded that the landlady simply made a mistake, because he told her that his name was Lee, meaning his first name.
LJ028-0125|LJSpeech|Along its edge I built a great wall of mortar and burned bricks mountain high.
LJ037-0262|LJSpeech|These facts warrant the finding that Lee Harvey Oswald disposed of his jacket as he fled from the scene of the Tippit killing.
LJ004-0175|LJSpeech|In this prison there was no female infirmary.
LJ005-0132|LJSpeech|Only a few glaring evils still demanded a remedy.
LJ015-0193|LJSpeech|By-and-by, when escape seemed hopeless, and after sentence, he suddenly degenerated into the lowest stamp of criminal,
LJ029-0119|LJSpeech|It afforded us a chance to have alternative routes if something happened on the motorcade route. It was the type of suburban area a good part of the way
LJ038-0177|LJSpeech|A note which Oswald left for his wife on the evening of the shooting,
LJ046-0096|LJSpeech|Nevertheless the procedures and advice should be accepted if the President wishes to have any security.
LJ018-0276|LJSpeech|The first plot was against Mr. Harry Emmanuel, but he escaped, and the attempt was made upon Loudon and Ryder.
LJ040-0122|LJSpeech|a junior high school in the Bronx, where the other children apparently teased him because of his, quote, western clothes and Texas accent.
LJ040-0078|LJSpeech|Lee Oswald remained with his mother and Ekdahl, to whom he became quite attached.
LJ049-0193|LJSpeech|Consequently the suggestion has been made, on the one hand, that all preventive investigative functions relating to the security of the President
LJ040-0012|LJSpeech|possibly by factors of which those around him were only dimly aware.
LJ008-0086|LJSpeech|A great concourse of people attended on this melancholy occasion.
LJ031-0158|LJSpeech|As soon as one of the agents learned of the shooting, he asked the officer in charge of the police detail at the airport
LJ044-0086|LJSpeech|executive director of the Information Council of the Americas, who also appeared on the program.
LJ018-0073|LJSpeech|This reply of his contained no promise of immediate release.
LJ006-0053|LJSpeech|and the whole by proper management might have been so accommodated as to prevent overcrowding.
LJ023-0041|LJSpeech|It is a quiet crisis. There are no lines of depositors outside closed banks.
LJ006-0225|LJSpeech|If any man presumed to turn in too early
LJ048-0010|LJSpeech|stressed also the decision by the Department of State that Oswald should be permitted to return to the United States.
LJ041-0063|LJSpeech|He said that Oswald, quote, seemed to guard against developing real close friendships, end quote,
LJ011-0207|LJSpeech|whom I never saw until I was taken from Liverpool, and never want to see again.
LJ033-0031|LJSpeech|had curtains and curtain rods, and that Oswald had never discussed the subject with her.
LJ032-0012|LJSpeech|the resistance to arrest and the attempted shooting of another police officer by the man (Lee Harvey Oswald) subsequently accused of assassinating President Kennedy
LJ037-0015|LJSpeech|but he saw the policeman leave the car, heard three or four shots, and then saw the policeman fall.
LJ041-0005|LJSpeech|He concluded that school had nothing to offer him.
LJ018-0290|LJSpeech|by paying in a genuine bill of Messrs. Rothschilds' for forty-five hundred pounds, which was duly discounted.
LJ032-0002|LJSpeech|Chapter four. The Assassin: Part one.
LJ034-0134|LJSpeech|Shortly after the assassination Brennan noticed
LJ007-0022|LJSpeech|After locking-up time, which varied, as on the male side, according to the daylight, the scenes were often riotous and disgraceful.
LJ024-0055|LJSpeech|We think it so much in the public interest to maintain a vigorous judiciary
LJ011-0086|LJSpeech|He then took to forging bank-notes, and was arrested as I have described above.
LJ032-0113|LJSpeech|Based on the above evidence, the Commission concluded that Oswald purchased the rifle found on the sixth floor of the Depository Building.
LJ027-0167|LJSpeech|Then the gills gradually dry up, as the lungs develop, and they now breathe wholly by lungs, but still retain the tail.
LJ024-0095|LJSpeech|Then would come the long course of ratification by three-fourths of all the states.

LJ037-0244|LJSpeech|Westbrook identified Commission Exhibit Number one sixty-two as the light-colored jacket which he discovered underneath the automobile.
LJ045-0051|LJSpeech|On the other hand, Oswald objected to the invitation that his wife had received to live with Mrs. Ruth Paine,
LJ032-0165|LJSpeech|to the exclusion of all others because there are not enough microscopic characteristics present in fibers.
LJ018-0359|LJSpeech|her object being first to dispose of the wife of a man for whom she had conceived a guilty passion,
LJ035-0152|LJSpeech|carrying a full bottle of Coca-Cola in his hand, presumably purchased after the encounter with Baker and Truly.
LJ025-0127|LJSpeech|I know of no test by which the reaction of the leaves of the Sundew and of other plants to stimuli, so fully and carefully studied by Mr. Darwin,

LJ036-0059|LJSpeech|The Marsalis bus which Oswald boarded traveled a route west on Elm,
LJ005-0192|LJSpeech|The prisoners were lodged in rooms whence they could converse with passengers in the streets, and freely obtain spirits and other prohibited articles.
LJ006-0123|LJSpeech|The man intrusted with this privilege was often the inner gatesman,
LJ016-0288|LJSpeech|"Müller, Müller, He's the man," till a diversion was created by the appearance of the gallows, which was received with continuous yells.
LJ038-0273|LJSpeech|Joseph D. Nicol,
LJ019-0021|LJSpeech|with the additions made to that date, the total expenditure amounted to nearly ninety thousand pounds, or about one hundred eighty pounds per cell.
LJ040-0163|LJSpeech|He also recommended that Mrs. Oswald seek, quote, psychotherapeutic guidance through contact with a family agency, end quote.
LJ027-0043|LJSpeech|and mean nothing more than similarity of environment.
LJ010-0071|LJSpeech|It was during this period that he was said to have imbibed his revolutionary ideas.
LJ026-0046|LJSpeech|In each the life is the sum total of a series of definite processes -- nutrition or food supply,
LJ002-0110|LJSpeech|Having thus briefly described the plan and appropriation of the prison, I propose to deal now with the general condition of the inmates, and the manner of their life.
LJ030-0198|LJSpeech|but then she noticed an almost imperceptible movement and knew that he was still alive. She said, quote, It's all right. Be still, end quote,
LJ038-0049|LJSpeech|Although the witnesses did not hear the sound of a misfire,
LJ047-0048|LJSpeech|while Oswald remained somewhat evasive at this interview, he was not antagonistic and seemed generally to be settling down.
LJ039-0119|LJSpeech|We have nothing here to show under what conditions the B course was fired. It might well have been a bad day for firing the rifle
LJ017-0181|LJSpeech|who had been in the habit of taking colchicum for rheumatism. Mrs. Wilson heard then casually from a medical man
LJ041-0017|LJSpeech|Voebel also recalled that Oswald once outlined a plan to cut the glass in the window of a store on Rampart Street and steal a pistol,
LJ003-0010|LJSpeech|wine and beer might be had in any quantity, the only limitation being
LJ044-0165|LJSpeech|He wanted to be arrested. I think he wanted to get into the newspapers, so that he would be known. End quote.
LJ011-0132|LJSpeech|except the forgery of wills and powers of attorney.
LJ050-0100|LJSpeech|The Commission recognizes that no set of meaningful criteria will yield the names of all potential assassins. Charles J. Guiteau,

LJ018-0206|LJSpeech|He was a tall, slender man, with a long face and iron-gray hair.
LJ041-0050|LJSpeech|In John Pic's view,
LJ016-0377|LJSpeech|The older officers, with several of whom I have conversed, have thus had unusual opportunities of watching the demeanor of murderers both before trial
LJ001-0157|LJSpeech|of this it may be said that though there is some good paper made now,
LJ032-0079|LJSpeech|Also in his wallet at that time
LJ017-0253|LJSpeech|A farmer took them in for the night, and drove them next day to Rocha, a place north of Maldonado.
LJ047-0095|LJSpeech|On the next day, he asked the New Orleans police to arrange for him to be interviewed by the FBI.
LJ040-0113|LJSpeech|They moved shortly after Robert joined the Marines; they lived for a time with John Pic who was stationed there with the Coast Guard.
LJ025-0102|LJSpeech|yet the exact researches of the modern chemical investigators of the physiological processes of plants have clearly demonstrated the fallacy

LJ028-0043|LJSpeech|Esarhaddon, the son of Sinacherib, was the next King of Nineveh.
LJ014-0224|LJSpeech|As Dwyer survived, Cannon escaped the death sentence, which was commuted to penal servitude for life.
LJ016-0417|LJSpeech|Catherine Wilson, the poisoner, was reserved and reticent to the last, expressing no contrition, but also no fear --
LJ004-0143|LJSpeech|so that the culprit, in addition to his sentence,
LJ036-0044|LJSpeech|Oswald had rented a room from Mrs. Bledsoe about six weeks before, on October seven, but she had asked him to leave at the end of a week.
LJ030-0038|LJSpeech|Every effort is made to prevent unscheduled stops, although the President may, and in Dallas did, order stops in order to greet the public.
LJ049-0133|LJSpeech|and to emphasize that the task of Presidential protection is one of broad national concern.
LJ014-0015|LJSpeech|picked up a coat-button, which afterwards played an important part in the identification of the murderer.

LJ016-0087|LJSpeech|Among the escapes still remembered was one in eighteen forty-nine, accomplished by a man who had been employed
LJ004-0113|LJSpeech|It was further ordered that male prisoners should be kept perfectly distinct from the females.
LJ031-0085|LJSpeech|Since the Dallas doctors directed all their efforts to controlling the massive bleeding caused by the head wound, and to reconstructing an airway to his lungs,
LJ019-0119|LJSpeech|but Mr. Pearson hardly considered the converse sufficiently, and
LJ002-0287|LJSpeech|There were no beds or bedding, no straw even.
LJ030-0232|LJSpeech|Roberts noticed that the Vice President's car was approximately one-half block
LJ042-0181|LJSpeech|Oswald realized that, quote, their thinking and education will be steeped in the traditions of those systems
LJ015-0294|LJSpeech|He forgot to add that it was to be placed to Ralph's credit, and when he called as Ralph,
LJ008-0112|LJSpeech|He was death's counterfeit, tall, shriveled, and pale;

LJ049-0141|LJSpeech|The foremost assignment of the Committee would be to insure that the maximum resources of the Federal Government are fully engaged in the job of protecting the President,
LJ047-0196|LJSpeech|The Commission has considered carefully the question whether the FBI,
LJ010-0204|LJSpeech|to wear a black crape mask, to obey punctually the orders of their commander-in-chief,
LJ020-0103|LJSpeech|are better than mere personal strength in the accomplishment of such tasks as fall to women to perform.
LJ046-0011|LJSpeech|One out of every five Presidents since eighteen sixty-five has been assassinated;
LJ005-0066|LJSpeech|"The new jails," as Howard says, "having pompous fronts, appear like palaces to the lower class of people, and many persons are against them on this account."

LJ002-0146|LJSpeech|The activity as well as the futility of these courts may be estimated from the statement given by Neild
